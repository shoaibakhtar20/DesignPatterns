Types of design patterns - 
--------------------------
1. Creational - object creation and initialization
eg- Singleton, Factory, Abstract Factory

2. Structural - class and object composition
eg - Adaptor, Bridge

3. Behavioural - communication between classes and objects

SINGLETON DESIGN PATTERNS-
---------------------------
-> only single object for a class is created and instantiated 
-> controls concurrent access to the resource
-> more controlled
